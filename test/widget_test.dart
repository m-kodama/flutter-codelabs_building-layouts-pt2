// This is a basic Flutter view_model test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a view_model in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility that Flutter provides. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the view_model
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of view_model properties are correct.
